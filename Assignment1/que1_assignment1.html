            console.log(1 + "2" + "2");  
            // output is 122 because it is priniting the same value. for no. there is no difference where we wrote with "" or not .
            console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
            // output is 32 because it is adding 1++2 =3 and print the third value same as 2.
            console.log(1 + "-1" + "2");
            // output is 1-12 because it is printing exactly the same values as above ie. 1, -1 and 2. therefore it is written as 1-12 
            console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
            // output is 112 beacause it is printing exactly the same values as above.
            console.log("A" - "B" + "2");
            // output is NaN2 because the value of A and B is not assigned and 2 is same as ove value.
            console.log("A" - "B" + 2);
            // output is NaN because the value of A and B is not assigned
